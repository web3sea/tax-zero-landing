# System Context

## Architecture
Next.js 14 app with component-driven architecture for landing page clone. Standalone frontend implementation with no external dependencies.

- **Design System**: Tailwind CSS with consistent design tokens
- **Animation System**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **UI System**: Radix UI + Tailwind components

## Data Flow
1. Static content rendering with Next.js
2. Component composition for landing page sections
3. Responsive behavior across breakpoints
4. Smooth animations and micro-interactions
